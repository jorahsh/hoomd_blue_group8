##Notes

- m_bond_data = bond data?
	int getTypeByName()
	BondType? getTypeByIndex()
	BondData::members getMembersByIndex()
- m_nList = NeighborList
- m_thermo = ComputeThermo
- m_pdata = particle data?
	int getTypeByName()
	int getN() --get number of particles?
	int getMaximumTag()
- m_bond_type = bond type array?

- A bond rank is the number of times a particle has been bonded.

##Journal

-This file has so many member variables...
-I feel like I have to spend a lot of time understanding what's going on in the code
 before I am comfortable deciding on an implementation.

##Description
-Judging by the way the the code is structured, it appears as though the update()
 function is being done on a single particle.
-The function begins by updating the list of neighboring particls.
-For the calculations needed by the update() function, the finction must define:
	Data about the particles neighbors. For the function to work, it requires:
		a number of neighbors array
		a neighbor list array
		a head list array
	Data about the particle: For the function to work, it requires:
		a position
		a rtag (a reverse lookup tag)
		a tag
